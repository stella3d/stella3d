# Stella Cannefax 

Long-time software engineer at [Unity](https://unity.com/), currently making tools for VR/AR creators.  

I'm an individual/technical contributor focused on real-time 3D. 


## Working On

â˜€:  Unity's [Mixed & Augmented Reality Studio](https://unity.com/products/mars), commonly known as MARS.  I specialize in its procedural content layout system.

## Tech Sucks (I know)

While I love my work, I find the dominant culture around technology creation to be very sad & exploitative.   

I often think about how much better technology could be - both for creators/workers and users - if most of us were not forced to create it in an environment focused on the profit motive. Always interested in meeting other tech workers who feel similarly & want to do something about it.


## Hobbies

At home on the dancefloor.  I do live video art (VJ-ing) & electronic dance music sometimes.  

## Get @ Me

My only public social media is [Twitter](https://twitter.com/simulacracid).  
 
I generally don't answer my email, so if you find it don't message me there.
